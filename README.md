# Testing an Angular application with Jest

## Comments appreciated

I've created this repository to learn how to use Jest and to collect best practices. At the time of writing, I'm a rookie, and you - dear reader - are probably more expert than me. In other words: I'm open to suggestions on how to improve the demos and the corresponding article on https://www.beyondjava.net/jest-mocks-and-spies.

## Angular 17

The Angular team published experimental support for Jest with Angular 16, but it took me until Angular 17 to take it for a ride. You find the result in the `Angular 17` folder. It's probably not perfect: the Angular team hasn't published a tutorial yet (or I didn't find it), so much of my code is guesswork.

## Angular 15 and below

Before Angular 16, there was no official support for Jest, but several great community solutions. The folder `Angular 15 and below` shows how to use Jest with an older Angular version. When I created the repository, Angular was at version 12, so I guess the recipe works for all versions from 12 to 15.
